#  CodeSnippet

Code snippets are a way to share iOS practices and facilitate their integration inside Xcode projects.

## Browse snippets

You can browse code snippets in the [CodeSnippet](https://github.com/faberNovel/CodeSnippet_iOS/tree/master/CodeSnippet.md) folder. Each snippet resides in its dedicated folder and provides a `README` file.

## Use snippets in Xcode

To facilitate their integration inside Xcode, each snippet is associated to a Xcode template.

To install the snippet templates in your machine, install [xctemplate](https://github.com/faberNovel/xctemplate-cli) and run `xctemplate install`. Run the command again to update them.

The snippet templates will be available inside Xcode anytime you create a new file (File > New > File or âŒ˜ + N).

> Once integrated, a snippet can be modified as much as you want. It should be tested and understood by you.
